Meditations on Moloch is far too long. Let’s not kid ourselves, we only read the whole thing because we’re silly little nerds. But Scott is having fun, he has so many examples he can’t help but write about all of them. 

Levine publishes almost everyday. If you read everything he writes, it’s going to start feeling a bit stale [vgr tweet]. Not for hime though, he’s having fun with it.

The funny thing is, I think good writer’s know this. It’s possible that they’re still as stupid as the rest of us, and bang their heads against sentences that were never meant to bet there. It’s also possible that years of experience have made them better at picking their battles and knowing when to stop. If you have a weekly/daily deadline, is the best way to grind out each post or skip to what comes easily?

 Knowing what to remove, including when to stop pressing. 

**If you have writer’s block, maybe you should stop trying.** 



Some pieces are just plain beautiful, there’s no getting around it. But I’ve also seen those writers write things that were merely passable. 

I can’t actually write in the fun voice if I’m not feeling like it. How am I supposed to dance across the page if it feels like crawling?

If I really wanted to, I could write something technical-ish. I could put on a teacher’s voice and monologue through a lesson on my thesis of “real stuff” economics, or relationship dynamics. Describing things while dissecting them, like so many dead frogs.  

But I hate doing that. 

You could argue that he isn’t a good writer. (You’d be wrong). You could say his ideas are a bit weird (you’d be justified). But the man is having. so. much. fun. 

Didn’t the best writers write a lot? Yeah, but they were very good. Nabeel tweet. 

**what the fuck is an essay anyway?**

mine have at least 4 sections. Why? idk.

This essay has 20. Some of those sections are one line long. it’s a good essay. What if I tried writing like that?
