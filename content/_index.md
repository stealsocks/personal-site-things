title: Things You Can Add To A Personal Site
---

This is a dangerous thing to do, giving away most of what I hold in my head about personal sites for free. This knowledge is what I'm usually paid for ([quite literally](https://webcraft.joodaloop.com)).

But the people have asked for it, and I'm a nice guy. Also, I have ideas that I couldn't find a way to neatly fit into each of these lists, so I'm not giving away *\*everything\**. 

**Note:** I will add a new page to this site every weekend until I've completed all 10 pages. If you see that I've missed a week, go yell at me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joodalooped).

<!-- Pick a concept. Is it a garden, a log book, a blog, a commonplace? -->
