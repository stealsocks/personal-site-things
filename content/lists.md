title: Lists

Curation, the fundamental duty of the netizen. So easy to do, and yet so many ways to do it ever-more thoughtfully. 

I'm only going to cover content, not how you should actually display these lists. Some presentation ideas have attained popular adoption (bookshelves with actual book cover images), but there are still hundreds yet to be tried. 


## Words

#### Authors/blogroll

You could have separate pages for people who write for "serious publications", and one for regular blogging plebs. Or a single page called "Writers" if you want to list them all together.

#### Quotes

You know what these are, I just want to mention how much I love [Bret Victor's](https://worrydream.com/quotes/) version.

#### Newsletters

I haven't really seen anybody do this yet, and newsletters are often a category of their own. Some of them don't have obvious archives. When they do, good posts are buried at the bottom of the stack. Authors are often pretty bad at promoting/describing their publication. You have a chance to try to fill in some of these gaps with your list.

#### Bookshelf + Anti-library

I've had the pleasure of designing a [couple](https://shreedasegan.com) of [these](https://jihad.house/shelf), and they're always fun to do. In some way, they are filling a gap left by the slow death (?) of Goodreads profiles.

Maggie's combination of bookshelf with her antilibrary is my favourite take on this genre so far, while [Anti-libraries](https://antilibrari.es/) is...exactly what the name suggests.

## Media

#### Playlists
Ordered by mood, or occassion, or . Maybe you can publish a new one each month.

#### Movies/shows
Including a short review/comparision with similar shows is a good touch. 

#### Talks
Technical talks, speculative visions, video essays, guy/girl talking to a camera. Usually as a Youtube or Vimeo link; personal commentary encouraged. I've only seen [one example](https://www.btbytes.com/Talks-I-liked.html) so far, so please make your own.



## Quality

#### Well-done page
What it sounds like, a collection of "_wonderful people, acts, and things_" that embody "thoughtfulness, craft, creativity, attention to detail, passion, and kindness". Stolen from [Aswath Krishnan's](https://www.aswathkrishnan.com/p/well-done.html).

#### Aha! explanations
Also inspired by [Aswath](https://www.aswathkrishnan.com/p/aha-explanations.html). 

#### Gift lists
Things that are good enough to give to other people. Some poeple, [like Robin](https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/2023-gift-guide/), publish an annual list.



## Personal

#### FAQ
Answers to questions you've been asked, and those you wish you were asked.

#### Uses/stack
Stuff you use, and why. Maybe even a few notes on the "how".

#### Places to visit
Or, if you haven't been anywhere, places from your neighbourhood.

#### Questions
Patrick Colisson was the first site I saw this on, but I have no doubt it's been done before.

#### Ideas
Give away your ideas for free, like all the people on [this list](https://joodaloop.com/idea-lists). 

#### TIL
You can call it a "Things I've Learnt" page if you don't want to be just about recent lessons. 

#### Miscellaneous
Things I Believe, Things I No Longer Believe, Green Flags, [Personal Syllabi](https://twitter.com/zhaovan8/status/1701737672740630704).


## Useful

#### Tricks of the trade
Pro tips, amateur tips, things you learned the hard way, things that are simple and worth doing.
