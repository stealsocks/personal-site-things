title: Layout
---

This is the highest-level decision you can make. 

Most other design details will follow from this one. If you go with a modern bento-box style, you're probably going to use a sans-serif. If you want your site to look like a beautifully typeset book, you better find a great serif.

I'm going to skip past horizontal scroll, because it's the web default (and it's a pretty good default too!).

## Horizontal scroll

If you really want to raise the information density of a page, you can't do much better than a vertical page + horizontal-scrolling sections. 

It is the classic *"browse, and go deeper when you feel like it"* layout.

You can fit in a ton of content like this â€“ the "blog" section could contain the entire history of your writing (not that much, since you never get around to publishing) without wasting vertical space.

**Warning!** This layout often sucks for people who aren't using a trackpad or phone screen. You'll need to add some kind of Javascript-based affordance for them to scroll (clickable arrows, maybe) or inform them that `shift` + scroll is what they need to try.

## Horizontal split

This one is surprisingly uncommon, compared to how well it can work for lots of people's content (portfolios, ).

It's not very different from a sidebar. Just like the sidebar, it contains the [navigation](/navigation) for your site. But it can hold way more information.
