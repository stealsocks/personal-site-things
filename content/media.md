## Video
The best way to share long-ish videos is, unfortunately, Youtube. They have the best infrastructure and their embeds will "just work". If you want to host your own, Cloudflare has pretty [cheap storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/) and no charge for egress.

GIFs are often larger than MP4s, for whatever reason. 


## Images
- Create something like a [Drawings](https://macwright.com/drawings/) page for your sketches/paintings.
- A photography page, or a [Sequence](https://brandur.org/sequences).
- A screenshot dump, a roughly chronological list of screenshots you feel like sharing.
- Visual inspiration, create and display your own moodboards.

I use a mix of [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) and [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to compress images. Prefer `.png`, `.svg` and `.jpg` since they're easy for users to download and view.


## Audio

- An audio recording as an introduction to your site
- Songs you've written, music you've played
- Audio clips of sounds that are precious/familiar/gathered from around the world.

MP3 has the most broad support across browsers, it's generally not a great idea to stream high-fidelity audio to users since many of them will be on slow/limited mobile broadband connections.
